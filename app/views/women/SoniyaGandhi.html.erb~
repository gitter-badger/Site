Sonia Gandhi (About this sound pronunciation (help·info); born Edvige Antonia Albina Màino,[1][2][3] 9 December 1946) is an Italian-born Indian politician, who has served as President of the Indian National Congress party since 1998.[2] She is the widow of former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi who belonged to the Nehru–Gandhi family. After her husband's assassination in 1991, she was invited by Congress leaders to take over the government but she refused and publicly stayed away from politics amidst constant prodding from the party.[4] She finally agreed to join politics in 1997; in 1998, she was elected President of the Congress party.[2]

She has served as the Chairperson of the ruling United Progressive Alliance in the Lok Sabha since 2004. She turned down the prayers of her party's rank & file to take over as Prime Minister after articulating Congress party victory in the 2004 Parlaiment elections by stating "My Conscience does not allow me". In September 2010, on being re-elected for the fourth time, she became the longest serving president in the 125-year history of the Congress party.[5] Her foreign birth has been a subject of much debate and controversy.[6][7] Also controversial was her alleged friendship with Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi, accused of being a middleman in the Bofors scandal.[8] Although Sonia is the fifth foreign-born person to be leader of the Congress Party, she is the first since independence in 1947.[9]
