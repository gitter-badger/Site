  <h2>This is a modal.</h2>
  <p>Reveal makes these very easy to summon and dismiss. The close button is simply an anchor with a unicode character icon and a class of <code>close-reveal-modal</code>. Clicking anywhere outside the modal will also dismiss it.</p>
  <p>Finally, if your modal summons another Reveal modal, the plugin will handle that for you gracefully.</p>
