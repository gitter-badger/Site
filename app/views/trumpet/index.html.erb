                    </p>
                    <p>There are four main self-defence strategies- psychological, technical, legal and physical. Mr.Anoop explained all these strategies with the help of a few girls.

                    <p>The girls were given a feedback form after the session. The session was conducted successfully with all the girls having learnt about self-defence.</p>
