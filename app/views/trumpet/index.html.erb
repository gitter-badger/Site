 <h2>SELF-DEFENCE WORKSHOP:</h2>
  <p>Aakriti in collaboration with survival instincts conducted self defense workshop for the girls of CEG on 18th October 2013. Mr.AnoopMadhavan, CEO of survival instincts and his intern Steffy came and conducted the workshop. The girls were taught the difference between knowing martial arts and the basic stances for protecting themselves. It was ensured that all the girls realised it is not important to know martial arts to protect oneself when situation arises.
</p>
<p>
There are four main self-defence strategies- psychological, technical, legal and physical. Mr.Anoop explained all these strategies with the help of a few girls. He laid importance on the most important step in self-defence- ESCAPE. He clearly explained that despite all best efforts, the smartest thing to do would be to leave the place immediately.</p>
<p>The girls were given a feedback form after the session. The session was conducted successfully with all the girls having learnt about self-defence.</p>
