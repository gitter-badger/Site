</p>
<p>
There are four main self-defence strategies- psychological, technical, legal and physical. Mr.Anoop explained all these strategies with the help of a few girls. He laid importance on the most important step in self-defence- ESCAPE. He clearly explained that despite all best efforts, the smartest thing to do would be to leave the place immediately.</p>
