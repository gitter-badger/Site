<!-- Reveal Modals begin -->
<div id="firstModal" class="reveal-modal" data-reveal>
  <h2>This is a modal.</h2>
  <p>Reveal makes these very easy to summon and dismiss. The close button is simply an anchor with a unicode character icon and a class of <code>close-reveal-modal</code>. Clicking anywhere outside the modal will also dismiss it.</p>
  <p>Finally, if your modal summons another Reveal modal, the plugin will handle that for you gracefully.</p>
  <p><a href="/admins/sign_up"  class="secondary button">Second Modal...</a></p>

<div id="secondModal" class="reveal-modal" data-reveal>
  <h2>This is a second modal.</h2>
  <p>See? It just slides into place after the other first modal. Very handy when you need subsequent dialogs, or when a modal option impacts or requires another decision.</p>
