 <p>There is a strong need for women to take up greater responsibilities and equip themselves with the knowledge of stress management and learn to face the world with courage and passion. Out of the 40% of women present in our college only ten percent participate in non collegiate activities. In olden days , Women did not get to make many of their own choices and a majority of the time their life was mainly mapped out for them prior to adulthood. And now given a chance or taking the advantage of the struggles made by the women of yesteryears they still break their necks to reach their goals. Noticing that women of our college need adequate emotional support and the need to handle problems without taking wrong and hasty decisions, the idea of a girls' forum emanated. </p>
